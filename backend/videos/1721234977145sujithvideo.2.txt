Redefine you and you can see the tide move just like tears in the eyes do. And when you're feeling oh, baby, I'll be right here between the scenes silence. So breathe easy, my dear you can find some shine in the rain I will come running when you call my name. Even a broken heart can be dug forget about the one who cause you pain. I swear I love you in a different way.
